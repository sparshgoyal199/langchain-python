## **Architecture & Implementation**

### **Q: How is the project structured?**
**A:** The project follows a modular architecture:

```
Internship_project/
├── intern_backend_folder/          # Backend application
│   └── backend/mains/
│       ├── main.py                # FastAPI application entry point
│       ├── config/db.py           # Database configuration
│       ├── model/db_models.py     # SQLModel data models
│       └── utils/utils_helper.py  # Utility functions
├── static/                        # Frontend static files
│   ├── html_folder/              # HTML pages
│   ├── css_folder/               # Stylesheets
│   ├── javascript_folder/        # Client-side JavaScript
│   └── image/                    # Static images
├── pyproject.toml                # Poetry configuration
├── requirements.txt              # Python dependencies
└── render.yaml                   # Deployment configuration
```

### **Q: How is the database designed?**
**A:** The database uses SQLModel with three main tables:

1. **Users Table:**
   - Primary user information (id, username, email, password, mobile)
   - Password validation with bcrypt hashing
   - Email and mobile number uniqueness constraints

2. **Books Table:**
   - Book information (book_id, name, author, google_id)
   - Unique google_id for book identification

3. **UserBookLink Table (Junction Table):**
   - Links users to their books
   - Contains book metadata (star rating, price, sale_price, quantity, discount, time)
   - Many-to-many relationship between users and books

## **Implementation Details**

### **Q: How is authentication implemented?**
**A:** Authentication uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Registration Process:**
   - User fills signup form with validation
   - Password is hashed using bcrypt
   - 6-digit OTP is generated and sent via email
   - User verifies OTP to complete registration

2. **Login Process:**
   - User credentials are validated
   - JWT token is generated with user ID
   - Token is stored in localStorage
   - Token is used for subsequent API calls

3. **Token Verification:**
   - JWT tokens are verified on protected routes
   - Token expiration is handled
   - Unauthorized access redirects to login

### **Q: How is image handling implemented?**
**A:** Image handling uses Supabase cloud storage:

1. **Image Upload:**
   - Images are converted to base64
   - Unique filenames are generated using secrets
   - Images are uploaded to Supabase bucket
   - Public URLs are stored in database

2. **Image Display:**
   - Images are served from Supabase CDN
   - Fallback handling for missing images
   - Modal view for full-size images

### **Q: How is the search functionality implemented?**
**A:** Search uses fuzzy matching:

1. **Real-time Search:**
   - Search as you type functionality
   - Fuzzy string matching using fuzzywuzzy library
   - Searches across book names and authors
   - Results update dynamically

2. **Book Name Autocomplete:**
   - Fetches book names from Google Books API
   - Provides autocomplete suggestions
   - Auto-fills author information

## **Security Features**

### **Q: What security measures are implemented?**
**A:** Multiple security layers are implemented:

1. **Password Security:**
   - bcrypt hashing with salt
   - Password strength requirements (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters)
   - Minimum length validation

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Server-side validation using Pydantic models
   - Client-side validation for immediate feedback
   - SQL injection prevention through ORM

3. **Authentication:**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Token expiration handling
   - Protected route middleware

4. **Data Protection:**
   - CORS middleware configuration
   - Environment variable usage for sensitive data
   - Input sanitization
